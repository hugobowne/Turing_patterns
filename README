Turing Patterns
---------------

Some python code to investigate some Turing-type mechanisms, now with OpenFrameworks visualisations: try running Turing_ring.py and/or image_reaction_diffusion.py. Coming soon: cleaning up the rest of this repository!

Dependencies
------------

OpenFrameworks app is located in the of_icos/ directory. This project needs to linked to a copy of the OpenFrameworks library,
at present the link directory (which is set in the config.make file) is set to /Users/james/src/of/. Evidently this needs to be changed for your particular build. One day we should sort out a better oF build system. All this only applies to building with gcc, I haven't touched the xcode project.

I'm also working on including integration between Python and C++ via the saved NumPy array files, using the following repository, which needs to be installed:
https://github.com/rogersce/cnpy

Evidently we might want to look at integrating these things better down the track, perhaps we could implement the Turing system in C++, calling say 3rd party Matlab ODE solvers in place of the SciPy ones.
